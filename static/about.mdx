# Meet Mazlin

Welcome, fellow dreamer\! I'm so happy our paths have crossed. I'm Mazlin, a wedding photographer who is here to capture the magic in your love story. I’d love to share a little bit about me– well this is the about me page, I guess that is why you came here.

I can be a bit of a daydreamer. I get lost in witchy fantasy novels or tending to my garden in Stardew Valley. There’s a sense of wonder and comfort in those feelings and that is what I seek to infuse into every photograph I take. I believe your wedding day is its own kind of beautiful fairytale, full of genuine emotion and delightful little moments that deserve to be cherished.

My happiest place would be a fresh oat capp with honey, windows open (but no bugs flying in), cookies baking in the oven, and my next audiobook ready to go in my headphones. _If this sounds like you, we should be friends._

Some more nitty-gritty details that you may also be interested in, is that I’ve been doing this for a while, eight years to be ~~exact~~ approximate. I started in Denton, TX, then moved to Austin now I’m in Portland, OR\! I love love love dreamy natural light and sunset photos, just look through the gallery, it’s full of ‘em.

My approach is all about creating a relaxed and enchanting atmosphere where you can truly be yourself. Think of me as a friendly storyteller, here to document your love in a way that feels natural, joyful, and imbued with a touch of whimsy. We'll capture the grand moments, of course, but also the sweet, candid whispers of your love story that unfold when you're simply basking in the glow of your special day.

If you're dreaming of wedding photos that feel like a warm embrace, sprinkled with a little bit of fairytale dust, and captured by someone who truly appreciates the beauty in both grand adventures and quiet, cozy moments, then I think we might be a perfect match.

I'd love to hear all about your own unique story and the magical day you're planning. Let's chat, let’s be friends, and see how we can create something truly special together.

xo,

## Maz
